module Num
  # Broadcasts two `Tensor`'s' to a new shape.  This allows
  # for elementwise operations between the two Tensors with the

  #
  # Broadcasting rules apply, and imcompatible shapes will raise
  # an error.
  #
  # Examples
  # ````````
  # a = Tensor.from_array [1, 2, 3]
  # b = Tensor.new([3, 3]) { |i| i }
  #
  # x, y = a.broadcast(b)
  # x.shape # => [3, 3]
